# SteamDSStub

My personal experiments with SteamKit2 and Steam dedicated servers.
Implements a stub Steam dedicated server that registers itself
to the master server. Does not provide any further functionality as of now.

Currently using my custom fork of [SteamKit2](https://github.com/tuokri/SteamKit).
