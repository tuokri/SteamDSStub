# SteamDSStub

My personal experiments with SteamKit2 and Steam dedicated servers.
Implements a stub Steam dedicated server that registers itself
with the master server. Simple A2S server is also provided. Does not provide any further functionality as of now.

Currently using my custom fork of [SteamKit2](https://github.com/tuokri/SteamKit).
